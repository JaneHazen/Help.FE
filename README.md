<i>Empowering women to help others in their time (of the month) of need.</i>

# The Problem:

At some point in their life, every woman has been stuck in the bathroom without the right equipment.

# The Tech: 
React-Native

# The App:

# Features: 

* Women (woman icon) can send out a distress call to nearby women 
* Women (blue icon) can respond to distress signals by starting a chat session to discuss where to hand-off the products
* Women's shelters (gift icon) can "ping" users when they walk by to remind women they can donate extra pads/tampons 

# Challenges:

This was the first time I had ever looked at React Native code, but I was able to draw on experience using other front-end frameworks to make sense of the structure and build out the maps portion. 

# Future plans: 

We would like to add the Stripe API to allow users to donate directly to women's shelters in another screen and possibly add the ability for shelters to also state specific needs for more donations.
